                        <p class="text-paragraph-16">Futures, stocks and options trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor.
                            The valuation of futures, stocks and options may fluctuate, and, as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment. 
                            The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. 
                            The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your 
                            trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains.
                            <br>
       
                           If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account.
                           You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources you use and for the chosen trading system.
                            You should not engage in trading unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering 
                            into and the extent of your exposure to loss. If you do not fully understand these risks you must seek independent
                             advice from your financial advisor.
                           <br>
